            <h2><b>How to Make Lasagna</b></h2>
    Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal! This is a really easy lasagna recipe.
    <ol>
        <li>Boil pasta: Cook in a large pot of salted water per the recipe below.</li>
        <li>Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li>Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><b>How to Layer Lasagna</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
        <li>Top the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake. Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>


        Once you have prepared the meat sauce and the cheese mixture, you’re ready to layer. This is the order of layers:

    sauce – noodles – cheese
    sauce – noodles – cheese
    sauce – noodles – cheese
    noodles – sauce (bake) – cheese

    <h2><b>Instructions</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large pot of salted water, boil lasagna noodles until al dente according to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or dutch oven, brown beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until thickened.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese. Bake for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
        <li>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><b>How Long to Bake</b></h2>
    Bake this lasagna recipe for a total of one hour. To get a perfect browned cheese topping, you’ll need to bake it in two stages.
    <ol>
         <li>Layer and cover it tightly with aluminum foil to retain the moisture.</li>
         <li>Once cooked, and heated through, remove the foil, top with cheese, and return to the oven for an additional 15 minutes, or until the top is browned and the lasagna is bubbling.</li>
    </ol>
